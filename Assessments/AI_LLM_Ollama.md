## AI, LLM, and Ollama Interview Questions

### What is Artificial Intelligence?

The simulation of human intelligence in machines.

### What are the types of AI?

Narrow AI, General AI, and Superintelligent AI.

### What is the difference between AI and ML?

AI is a broader concept; ML is a subset of AI focused on learning from data.

### What is machine learning?

An AI technique that allows systems to learn from data.

### What are the types of machine learning?

Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

### What is deep learning?

A type of machine learning using neural networks with many layers.

### What is a neural network?

A model inspired by the human brain composed of layers of nodes.

### What is overfitting?

A model that performs well on training data but poorly on new data.

### What is underfitting?

A model that is too simple to capture the patterns in data.

### What is model evaluation?

The process of assessing the performance of a model.

### What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

A type of AI trained to understand and generate human language.

### How does an LLM work?

It uses deep learning, particularly transformers, to learn language patterns.

### What are examples of LLMs?

GPT-4, LLaMA, Claude, PaLM.

### What is a transformer model?

A neural network architecture using attention mechanisms.

### What is the role of attention in transformers?

It helps models focus on relevant parts of the input.

### What is fine-tuning?

Training an LLM further on a specific dataset to adapt it to a task.

### What is prompt engineering?

Designing input prompts to elicit better responses from LLMs.

### What is zero-shot learning?

Using an LLM to perform tasks without task-specific training.

### What is few-shot learning?

Providing a few examples in the prompt to help the LLM learn.

### What is a token in LLMs?

A chunk of text (like a word or subword) processed by the model.

### What are embeddings in LLMs?

Numerical representations of text capturing semantic meaning.

### What is context length in LLMs?

The maximum number of tokens the model can consider at once.

### What is a decoder-only architecture?

A transformer model that generates output sequentially.

### What is the difference between encoder and decoder in transformers?

Encoders process input, decoders generate output.

### What is a hallucination in LLMs?

When a model generates false or misleading information.

### What is chain-of-thought prompting?

Prompting that encourages the model to reason step-by-step.

### What is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)?

Combining LLMs with external search to retrieve facts.

### What is LangChain?

A framework for building applications with LLMs and external tools.

### What is vector search in LLM pipelines?

Finding similar texts using vector embeddings.

### What is an agent in LLM pipelines?

An entity that can plan and use tools to solve tasks.

### What is Ollama?

A platform to run and manage LLMs locally.

### What are Ollama models?

Optimized, containerized LLMs ready to run locally.

### How do you run a model with Ollama?

Using the command `ollama run <model>`.

### What is the benefit of running LLMs locally?

Greater privacy, control, and offline usage.

### Can Ollama models be customized?

Yes, you can create custom models using Modelfile.

### What is a Modelfile in Ollama?

A configuration file to build custom models.

### What types of models are supported by Ollama?

Models like LLaMA, Mistral, Phi, and others.

### How does Ollama use system resources?

It runs models using your systemâ€™s CPU/GPU.

### Is Ollama open source?

Parts of Ollama are open-source, with proprietary components.

### How do you stop a running model in Ollama?

Using the command `ollama stop <model>`.
