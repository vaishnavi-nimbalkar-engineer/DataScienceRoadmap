### Section: Machine Learning â€“ Python Code Snippets & Explanations

#### âœ… 1. Difference between Linear and Logistic Regression

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression, make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Linear Regression Example
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=10)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Linear Regression RÂ² score:", lr.score(X_test, y_test))

# Logistic Regression Example
X_class, y_class = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=2, n_classes=2)
Xc_train, Xc_test, yc_train, yc_test = train_test_split(X_class, y_class, test_size=0.2)

clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(Xc_train, yc_train)
print("Logistic Regression accuracy:", clf.score(Xc_test, yc_test))
```

**Explanation:**
- Linear regression is for continuous output (e.g., price).
- Logistic regression is for categorical output (e.g., spam/ham).

#### âœ… 2. Overfitting vs Underfitting (with Visualization)

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# Generate Data
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.sort(5 * np.random.rand(80, 1), axis=0)
y = np.sin(X).ravel() + np.random.normal(0, 0.2, X.shape[0])

# Underfitting
model_under = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(1), LinearRegression())
model_under.fit(X, y)

# Overfitting
model_over = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(15), LinearRegression())
model_over.fit(X, y)

# Plot
X_test = np.linspace(0, 5, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
plt.plot(X_test, model_under.predict(X_test), label="Underfitting", color='red')
plt.plot(X_test, model_over.predict(X_test), label="Overfitting", color='green')
plt.scatter(X, y, edgecolor='k')
plt.legend()
plt.title("Underfitting vs Overfitting")
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**
- Use polynomial degrees to simulate over/underfitting.
- Visualize the gap between model predictions and actual data.

#### âœ… 3. Confusion Matrix & Classification Report

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, test_size=0.3)

clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

**Explanation:**
- Confusion matrix shows TP, TN, FP, FN.
- Classification report includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### âœ… 4. Cross-validation and Grid Search

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(SVC(kernel='linear'), X_train, y_train, cv=5)
print("Cross-validation scores:", scores)

# Grid Search
params = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']}
grid = GridSearchCV(SVC(), params, cv=3)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Best parameters:", grid.best_params_)
```

**Explanation:**
- Cross-validation evaluates model performance on unseen data.
- Grid search finds optimal hyperparameters.

#### âœ… 5. Feature Importance with Random Forest

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

feat_imp = clf.feature_importances_
sns.barplot(x=feat_imp, y=data.feature_names)
plt.title("Feature Importance")
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**
- Helps understand what features influence predictions the most.
- Useful for interpretability and feature selection.
